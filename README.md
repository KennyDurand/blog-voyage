## Installation

### Requirements

Before anything, you need the following programs installed on your host:

  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
  * [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)


### Process

In your development folder, run `vagrant up` to launch the virtual machine and update it.

Your Virtual machine should be up at this point, and you should have the project running at: http://blog-voyage.wordpress.com
